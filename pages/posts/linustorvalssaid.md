# Linus Torvalds said

> The difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. â€“ Linus Torvalds


## Code

```
export default function Nextra({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <link
          rel="alternate"
          type="application/rss+xml"
          title="RSS"
          href="/feed.xml"
        />
        <link
          rel="preload"
          href="/fonts/Inter-roman.latin.var.woff2"
          as="font"
          type="font/woff2"
          crossOrigin="anonymous"
        />
      </Head>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  )
}
```
